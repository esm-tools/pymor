"""
Repoint the 17 HR pycmor tier yamls at a different model run + year.

Reads each `awi-esm3-veg-hr-variables/<tier>/cmip7_awiesm3-veg-hr*.yaml`,
swaps the hard-coded HR_test_01 paths to the requested run, and adds a
year filter to the input regex `pattern:` entries:

  - FESOM patterns          \\.fesom\\..*\\.nc      ->  \\.fesom\\.<YEAR>\\.nc
  - OIFS  patterns          atm[...]_.*\\.nc        ->  atm[...]_<YEAR>-<YEAR>\\.nc
  - LPJ-GUESS patterns      */run1/*.out            ->  unchanged (per-var file
                                                       contains all years)

Outputs the modified yamls into <workdir>, leaving the source tree clean.

Usage:
  repoint_hr_year.py <RUN_NAME_OR_ABSPATH> <YEAR> <WORKDIR> [EXPERIMENT]

EXPERIMENT (or the EXPERIMENT env var) selects the metadata profile
written into `inherit:` — default piControl, which is what the source
yamls already carry. Use `historical` for a branch-off run.

Examples:
  repoint_hr_year.py Test_16n 1587 /scratch/$USER/cmorize_Test_16n_y1587
  repoint_hr_year.py /work/bb1469/.../runtime/awiesm3-develop/Test_16n 1587 ./out

# and the year but knows nothing about which experiment produced that data --

# times in the result: a DRS directory level, a filename field, and a global

# point is 36524 days in; the child branches at its own origin, hence 0.0.
